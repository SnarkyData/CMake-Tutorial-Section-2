# CMake Tutorial - CMake for Cross-Platform Project Build

This repository contains a directory with .cpp, .o, .h, and makefiles 
for a tutorial on how to write, modularize, compile, and build executables
for a partial calculator program.

I used C++ and Vim on a Fedora 36 system in a VirtualBox environment to
create and manage these directories and their respective files.

Please feel free to reach out to me at matthewjohnson@snarkydata.com if
you have any questions or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize
these files and reference the CMake Tutorial on Udemy.com. The course is
called 'Master CMake for Cross-Platform C++ Project Building'.
